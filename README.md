Create a deep learning classifier that will guess the mathematical function from a graph.

Since a human can many times guess, upon watching a graph, what is the mathematical function that would likely create this graph, I thought that a deep learning algorithm might also work. 

It is easy to create infinite amount of image samples for this task!
